This C++ program implements a simple bank management system with classes for Transaction BankAccount, and Bank
Transaction Class:

Provides a constructor to initialize transaction details and a display function to print transaction information.
BankAccount Class:
Represents a bank account with attributes for account number, account holder's name, balance, and a vector to store transaction history.
Provides a constructor to initialize account details and functions for deposit, withdrawal, and displaying account information, including the transaction history.
Bank Class:
Manages a collection of BankAccount objects.
Provides functions to add an account, display all accounts, and find an account by account number.
Main Function:
Demonstrates the usage of the implemented classes.
Creates sample bank accounts, performs deposits and withdrawals, and displays account information.
The code follows a modular structure with separate header and implementation files for each class, promoting code organization and reusability. It uses object-oriented principles to model bank entities and operations. The provided main function serves as a demonstration of the implemented functionality.
